# Thai mobile phone numbers enumeration
[Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/) mask definitions for generating a full list of _more-or-less_ all possible valid mobile numbers in Thailand.

The prefix code data used was based on [the current (Aug 2022) Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Thailand).

The generated list (~280,000,000 candidates) is in no way guaranteed to be either complete or accurate. Use for hobby purposes only!
